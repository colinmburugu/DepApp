             Your score is {{index}}.This exhibits severe depression.Roughly half of those who
             have a single untreated episode of major depression will go on to have another.The second untreated episode
            boosts the odds of a third.Therefore, treatment should aim for maximum relief.
            Here are some other strategies worth considering in the search for a lasting, full recovery:</p>
             <ul>
               <li>switching to a different antidepressant if the first one
                is not adequately effective</li>
               <li>combining two antidepressants that have different
                mechanisms of action</li>
               <li>adding a second drug (not primarily an antidepressant) that may augment the effect of the antidepressant
                 you’re taking</li>
               <li>combining medications and therapy.</li>
             </ul>
            <p> Most psychiatrists will recommend that you stay on your medication for about a year after a first
                episode of depression. If you have had several episodes, your doctor will probably recommend maintenance
                treatment indefinitely.</p>
